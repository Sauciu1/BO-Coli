### About This App
This application enables no-code Bayesian Optimization experiments.
It allows the user to find the optimal parameters for a black-box response function.

The HeteroWhiteNoise evaluates heteroscedastic noise from technical repeats and combines it with a small white noise to ensure numerical stability.
It was specifically designed to handle noise and technical replicates and thus should serve biological data extremely well.


### Quick Start Guide
* **Initialize**: Start a new experiment or load an existing one using the sidebar options.
    * New Experiment: Configure parameters, input initial data, and set up the optimization process.
* **Manage Groups**: Create and manage experimental groups, each with its own desirable number of replicates and data.
* **Run Optimization**: Use the built-in Bayesian Optimization tools to suggest new experimental conditions based on your data.
* **Visualize Results**: Utilize the integrated visualization tools to analyze and interpret your experimental results.
* **Download Data**: Save your experiment state and results, the file can be reuploaded during the next session.

**NOTE** - Ensure to save your experiment data before closing the app to avoid data loss. There is no auto-save feature.
    

### Life Cycle
The application was developed by Povilas from Imperial's iGEM 2025, to support the wet lab experimentation.
It will be maintained and updated, however, is static as part of the iGEM competition up until wiki thaw 9th November 2025.
Link to active GitHub repository will be provided here after the competition.
* Main changes will include hosting and data storage solutions. Both of which could not be implemented due to iGEM rules.
